## Single purpose

An extension must have a single purpose that is narrow and easy-to-understand.

### Single purpose description

```
NanoKVM Capture is a Chrome extension designed specifically to enhance NanoKVM's functionality by adding screenshot and video recording capabilities. This extension allows users to capture and record their NanoKVM remote desktop sessions directly from their browser, providing essential documentation and troubleshooting capabilities for system administrators and users working with NanoKVM-managed devices.
```

## Permission justification

A permission is either one of a list of known strings, such as "activeTab", or a match pattern giving access to one or more hosts.
Remove any permission that is not needed to fulfill the single purpose of your extension. Requesting an unnecessary permission will result in this version being rejected.

### scripting justification
